# instructbot
The 'instructbot' project is an interactive Python application that showcases a functional chatbot. This chatbot is engineered to comprehend and reply to user inquiries based on predefined responses stored in a JSON file. Leveraging the capabilities of difflib and get_close_matches, the chatbot excels in understanding similar phrases, enabling precise and contextual responses. To offer an intuitive and user-friendly experience, the project utilizes Tkinter for crafting an interactive graphical user interface (GUI).
